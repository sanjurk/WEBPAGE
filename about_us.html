                          <p>
                              I have created Webpage Design at MCA, Presidency College.<br> This was originally created as part of a second semester pre- practical examination<br> in which i'm supposed to create a web design application.
  <p align= "right">
  Since the pre-pratical examination, i have taken<br> many more endeavors, such as learning HTML, CSS and javascript in order to create<br> web pages on my own instead of relying on other applications to see<br> my creative visions through.</right>
